# Data-Life-PR
## Description
Data life is a simple code that will emulate life with parameterized datasets. Using the data from thousands of people that died from COVID-19 in Puerto Rico, this code creates a series of unique art NFT pieces with their authorized medical data. These pieces represent a token of love, hope, redemption, and understanding of how important life is. In memorium of all the puertoricans that died from the virus 2020-2021.  A total of 3272 NFTs will be minted and sold. LOVE ALL

## Requirements

 p5.js (v1.4.0) <br>
 node.js (v16.13.1) <br>
 paper.js (v0.12.15) <br>
 GitKraken (v8.1.1) <br>
 http-server (v14.0.0) <br>
 
## Roadmap
The platform essentially integrates each minter's opportunity with the unique data from each of the warriors that lost the battle to COVID-19 in Puerto Rico. As a homage to the people of today's age, a ubiqutuous token will be generated from specific features that have been shared for every ID in the dataset. As of today, the GitHub repo supports a Mark-Up program with the scripts for preprocessing of the dataset and generating the specifications for an art piece as an NFT. Future plans include integrating the dataset's parsed parameters as a unique ID for the minting process on the complete release of all the 3272 NFT as an unrepeatable art collection.
